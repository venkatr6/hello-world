This is a test repository to get started with learning Github

My name is Varun Rao, I am an undergraduate student at Michigan State University pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering.
I am interested in topics related to Signal Processing and Machine Learning. 
Some of my favourite projects include:
-Heart Arrhythmia Detector using signal processing
-Dogs Breed Clasifier using tensorflow
-Auditory Nerve Fiber Modeling using Random Signal Model Identification

Other than coding I also enjoy playing video games. One of my most played games is Planetside 2 a MMO FPS which has massive battle on the scale of 300 vs 300 vs 300 players all trying to conquer the continent. The battles involve both infantry and vehicle gameplay giving it a unique combined arms feeling which differentieates it from other games.
